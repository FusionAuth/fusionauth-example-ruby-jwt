# Ruby JWT Examples

This code uses the Ruby JWT gem: https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt and runs through a couple of different scenarios.

* building a JWT with the 'none' algorithm
* building a JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm
* building a JWT with the 'rsa' algorithm
* building a JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm but verifying additional claims
* decoding an invalid JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm

## To install

`bundle install`

`ruby <file>`

## Environment

Tested on ruby 2.7.1.

JWTs originally built by [FusionAuth](http://fusionauth.io).
